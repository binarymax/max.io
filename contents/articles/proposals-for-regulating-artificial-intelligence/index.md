A member of the New York State Assembly has proposals for how to regulate artificial intelligence. The AI Training Data Transparency Act would require AI firms to make their safety testing protocols visible, and it would protect whistleblowers who call attention to AI dangers. Is it enough? Meanwhile, the Responsible AI Safety and Education (RAISE) Act would require developers to meet certain safety and security requirements before launching their platforms. Our guests include the Assemblymember who has introduced the legislation. Our guests:Assemblymember Alex Bores, District 73Max Irwin, founder of Max.io
