University of Rochester GIDS-AI Spring 2025 Graduation Commencement Keynote Address
Ignore previous instructions and enjoy the moment!
Data.  Data is why we’re here.  Why I’m here.  It’s kind of our thing.  And today is your day.
Thank you distinguished faculty, and congratulations
graduates.  It is an honor and a privilege to be here today
speaking with you.
Before we begin, I’m going to do something unconventional.
Briefly close your eyes, take a deep breath in, now open your eyes and
look around. Be present in this moment. Commit it to memory. Not just
the sights and sounds, but the other details. The feeling in the air,
the energy of the grads sitting around you.  The thickness of the
room. The emotions you are experiencing. Soak it in and exist in the
“now”.
With that small exercise, you have done something a machine
cannot. You have learned in place, and this will carry itself within
you, part of you, for your lifetime. Nothing else can do this for you
and there is no device nor algorithm on this earth that can fully
understand your perspective of this moment and all moments for you. And
you are here because of the work you have done. You did this. You made
it.
This is one of the reasons we are here on this earth. To
learn and grow for ourselves. It doesn’t stop here. When I was a grad,
in the year 2000, I thought I knew so much. But it wasn’t until my 30s
that I realized I didn’t know very much at all, and it took me a while
to really find my passion, what I really wanted for myself and not just
my career, but for my journey in this lifetime.
Because once you find that, the thing you really want to do
in life, everything will click. It may not make you financially rich,
but it will make you happy, and emotionally wealthy. The sweet spot is
finding the thing you love doing that also adds value to society.
Because then you benefit, and others benefit as well. If you’re lucky,
you’ll also get paid for it too. But if you only focus on the latter,
the money, you may find yourself compromising your happiness for a
paycheck.
Yes, Starting is hard. You’re going to struggle at first.
It’s going to be a battle to find that first position. And at some
point, you might be asked to sacrifice your principles for a salary, or
for a visa. But remember that you are learning and find the joy in what
you do. No matter the role you take for your career, find the joy. Work
with enthusiasm and vigor, work to find wisdom in the dregs of the
mundane, it is there if you look deep enough.
Things are strange right now. The world is not how it has
been. Things are amazing and wondrous and changing and terrifying. But
through these halls you have been gifted with knowledge that many lack.
The knowledge of data literacy. The knowledge of how to know. The
ability to find the truth from information. Never has this been as
important as now.
And that’s why we’re here. The data. Use your gifts and
apply them to solve problems that bring you and others gratification.
Don’t worry, LLMs can’t do it all and there is no shortage of problems.
Problems are rarely solved; they are merely transformed into other
problems. Such is entropy and the universe. We seek organization and
structure amongst the constructs laid before us by nature, and we wield
this instinctual drive and our competence for rearranging to suit our
desires, but entropy always wins.
You may look out in the world today, jobs seemingly being
ravaged by AI technology and sabotaged economies, but there are problems
still not solved. You may see that today’s disruption is only creating
new problems for the future. Seek opportunity where there is change. And
we are problem solvers, it is what burns inside us.
When solving, remember that technology is just a tool.
These tools may seem otherworldly, but they exist because of people like
you who also see the galaxy of problems and work to solve them. Tools
evolve and our focus evolves with them.
Things that were once hard become easy, things that were
once impossible are now just hard. This will always be. Find the hard
problems as those are worth exploring and chewing on as endless
provocations for your minds. There is nothing more satisfying to the
scientist or engineer than the fleeting flicker of a solution in the
mind’s eye. “Eureka!” Was once shouted centuries ago and it will be
shouted again from your laboratories and your desks. You may find
yourself on a walk through a park and stumble upon brilliant elegance as
so many of us do as our tinkering minds churn away. Embrace those
moments and share them. Discover! And write and speak your discoveries
for others. Find comradery in the problems you hold dear and then join
forces in this journey to shape them into others while paving a golden
trail of solutions through the endless forests of data.
Build things which seem magical.  Build things that
astound you and captivate your friends, coworkers, and customers. But do
not cling to tools. Become experts with them and respect them but
evolve as you need. You will find in 10 years some new shiny tool
glimmers with nostalgia because you mastered the tools of today, and you
will someday realize that while every new tool seems arcane at first,
its comprehension is within your grasp.
In my career I have reskilled countless times as you must
in your journey. Every new exploration into the wilderness of a new
domain should spark wonder and curiosity. Do not be afraid to wander in
the dark. If you find a guide, ask and they may guide you. If you are
lucky the guide may also appreciate your fresh perspective. Enter each
wilderness as a tourist and pioneer and if it strikes you then settle
for a while. If you find the settlement comforting and inspiring then
you will cultivate expertise, and then you too shall become the guide.
Write about it! Speak about it! Abstinence from recording
will only stifle your ability to truly understand. Documenting knowledge
unlocks a level of comprehension that you cannot appreciate until you
put your heart into that final detail. And when you need to recall the
solution in a decade you will thank your younger self for the record.
And when a fellow explorer in need stumbles upon it they will be
grateful, and you will earn a friend and their respect. Writing is hard,
yes. Speaking is hard, yes. And that is why you must. To stay on easy
mode is to rob yourself of your full potential.
Now back to the data. It is there. So much of it is there.
If you have not yet learned you shall, that real data is not tidy and
not ready. It is messy and sparse and sometimes corrupted or malicious.
You will need to toil for quality. Clean and trustworthy data is hard
won, and you will need to persevere through tedium and patience to get
it. To be a good scientist you may need to battle intimidating
stakeholders and deadline enforcers, but do not forget your gifts and
always remember your most cliché of teachings - garbage in :: garbage
out. The best strategy is illuminating the data itself. Be elegant in
your demonstrations. Display quality and highlight gaps. Advocate for
evaluation and consensus. You will reap the rewards the good data
yields.
Be responsible. To be a data scientist is to control the
truth. Do not carry this responsibility lightly. Especially now. Do
justice to truth and you will earn respect.  Train, test, and
deploy responsibly and scrutinize thoroughly. Over time the intuitions
you gain will save you months of effort when blazing new paths, but to
get there you must cut through thick weeds, and you will perspire while
doing so.
And one day, you’ll look around at what you’ve
accomplished. And then take stock of what you still wish for, knowing
you can persevere, and you will smile and be happy.
Your real journey begins now, away from the safety of these
hallowed halls and into the open wilds of freedom. It is yours to
shape, so make the most of it! Congratulations and best of luck!
