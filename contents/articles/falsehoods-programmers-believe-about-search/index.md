Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Search
105 falsehoods programmers believe about search, a complex field where competence is hard-won through training, practice, and experience.
As much as anyone I’m a fan of resurrecting trends and memes and pretending it’s cool. In that vein dear friends, I’ve exhumed the venerable “Falsehoods Programmers Believe” party from 4 years ago to bring you one about, no less, Search.
Search is a deceptively complex field, where competence is hard-won through training, practice, and experience. The list stands at a total of 105 falsehoods. I couldn’t mash up the ole 99-problems meme with this to cull 6 unworthy items, because they are all worthy. I will leave you with that brief introduction and, of course, the list:
Search engines work like databases
Search can be considered an additional feature just like any other
Search can be added as a well performing feature to your existing product quickly
Search can be added as a well performing feature to your existing product with reasonable effort
Choosing the correct search engine is easy and you will always be happy with your decision
Once setup, search will work the same way forever
Once setup, search will work the same way for a while
Once setup, search will work the same way for the next week
The default search engine settings will deliver a good search experience
Customers know what they are looking for
Customers who know what they are looking for will search for it in the way you expect
Customers who don’t know what they are looking for will search accordingly
A customer using the same query twice expects the same results for both searches
Customers only search for a few terms
Customers only search for less than some set number of terms
Customers never copy and paste a whole document into a search bar
Customers balance quotes and parenthesis
Customers that don’t balance quotes or parenthesis don’t expect phrasing or grouping
You can pass the customer query directly into your search engine
You can write a query parser that will always parse the query successfully
You will never have to return a query parse error to the customer
When you find the boolean operator ‘OR’, you always know it doesn’t mean Oregon
Customers notice their own misspellings
Customers don’t expect your search to correct misspellings
It is possible to create a list of all misspellings
It is possible to create an algorithm to handle all misspellings
A misspelled word is never the same as another correctly spelled word
All customers expect spelling correction to work the same
All customers want their misspellings corrected
A search should always return results, no matter how absurd
If you don’t have any results to show, customers won’t mind
When the perfect results are shown to the customer, they will notice it
You don’t need to monitor search queries, results, and clicks
Customers won’t get nervous that you are logging their search activity
Search queries are not affected by GDPR
Looking at the data, it is always possible to tell whether a customer found what they were looking for
Customers will click on what they are looking for when they’ve found it
You can build a search that works like Google
You can build a search that works like Google sometimes
You should use Google as a target for your search
Customers don’t mind if your search doesn’t work like Google
Customers don’t expect your search to work like Google
Customers won’t compare you to Google
A bad search, no matter how minor nor how rare, will never reflect poorly on your product
Since Google doesn’t use facets, customers don’t need them
Facet hit counts are always correct
Facets have no impact on performance
You can just cache queries to get performant facets
Personalized search is easy
Learning to rank is easy and just requires a plugin
You have enough data for learning-to-rank
Over time, you can curate enough data for learning-to-rank
You don’t need to spend lots of time formatting content for it to work well in your search engine
Text extraction engines will always produce text that doesn’t need to be post-processed
All your markup will be stripped as you expect it to be
Content is well formed
Content is mostly well formed
Content is predictably well formed
Content, sourced from a database and templates, are formed the same
Content teams treat search as their top priority
Manually changing content to improve search is easy
Improving content can be automated with reasonable effort
Queries for ‘C programming’ and ‘C++ programming’ will produce different results
Queries for ‘401k’ and ‘401(k)’ will produce the same results
Tokenization as it works out of the box is right for your content and queries
Tokenization can be changed to meet the needs of your entire corpus and all queries
Tokenization can be changed to meet the needs of most of your corpus and most queries
Tokenization can be conditional
You should roll your own tokenizer
You will never have a debate about tokenization
Regular Expressions for tokenization is a good idea
Regular Expressions have minimal performance impact
You will never have a debate about regular expressions
You should remove stop words
You should not remove stop words
You know what the list of stop words should be
Stop words will never change
When you find the stopword ‘in’, you know it doesn’t mean Indiana
It’s easy to make certain things case sensitive
Case sensitivity is a good idea
Synonyms are easy
Synonyms will improve recall in the way you want
Synonyms have the same relevance in all documents
Synonyms for Abbreviations and Acronyms always work as you expect
Synonyms can be extracted from your corpus with natural language processing
Using Word2Vec for synonyms is a good idea
Stemming will solve your recall problems
Lemmatization will solve your recall problems
Lemmatization dictionaries are static
Languages don’t change
Natural language processing (NLP) tools work perfectly
Incorporating NLP into your analysis pipeline is straightforward
Search queries are complete sentences and can be accurately tagged with parts of speech
Showing a list of search suggestions is easy
Suggestions should just use the out of the box search engine suggestions
Suggestions should incorporate customer query logs
Customers would never type anything offensive into your search bar
Customers would never try to hack you through your search bar
Customers don’t need highlighting to find what they’ve searched for
Default highlighters are good enough for all your content and queries
Making a custom highlighter isn’t too difficult. It’s just matching strings right?
Making a custom highlighter that is better than the default version will take less than a year
Turning on caching will solve your performance issues
Customers don’t expect near real time updates
30 second commit time is short enough for everyone
